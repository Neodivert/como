COMO: Cooperative Modeller
====

## About
COMO is a project which aims to create a Cooperative Modeller, where users could share and work on a 3D scene at the same time. Two examples where this can be useful are presented:
* An online modelling course. Teacher can chat with his/her students and teach them how to create the model while doing it. When finished, students can try to make their own models while the teacher supervises the process.
* A team working on a map for a videogame. Main designer can sketch the world while the others see it. When finished, the main designer assignes each part of the map to a junior designer, so all can work in parallel while seeing how the whole map envolves.

## Roadmap
The proyect will be developed through prototypes.

### First prototype. Goals
For the first prototype, user will be capable of
- [] Creating cubes.
- [] Deleting cubes.
- [] Selecting and translating cubes in X, Y or Z.
- [] Selecting and rotating cubes in X, Y or Z.
